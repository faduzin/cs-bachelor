## Supply and Demand

### Law of Supply and Demand
- **Supply** is the desire to sell goods or services.
- **Demand** is the desire to purchase goods or services.
- The interaction between supply and demand is commonly represented on a graph where:
  - The vertical axis shows the *price*.
  - The horizontal axis shows the *quantity*.
  - Supply and demand curves intersect at a single point known as the **equilibrium point**, where the market is balanced.

### Behavior of Supply and Demand
- When the *quantity* of a product is **high**:
  - Supply tends to be **high**.
  - Demand tends to be **low**.
- When the *quantity* is **low**:
  - Demand tends to be **high**.
  - Supply tends to be **low**.

### Related Concepts
- **Essentiality**: Indicates whether a product is unique or has substitutes.
- **Market**: Defined as the interaction between a buyer and a seller.

### Demand Function
- Demand depends on multiple factors:
  - Price of the product
  - Prices of similar products (substitutes)
  - Consumer income
  - Consumer preferences

To isolate the impact of a specific variable, other variables are held constant (*ceteris paribus*). For example:
- An increase in income shifts the demand curve to the **right** (higher quantity demanded at the same price).
- The **steepness** of the demand curve reflects how essential a product is:
  - A **steep (vertical)** curve indicates **inelastic demand** (e.g., essential goods).
  - A **flat (horizontal)** curve indicates **elastic demand** (e.g., non-essential goods).

### Elasticity
Elasticity measures how sensitive demand or supply is to changes in key variables:

#### Price Elasticity of Demand
- If |elasticity| > 1 → **Elastic**
- If |elasticity| < 1 → **Inelastic**
- If |elasticity| = 1 → **Unitary Elasticity**

#### Revenue Elasticity
- Revenue = Price × Quantity
- If elasticity is unitary, changes in price or quantity will not significantly affect total revenue.

#### Income Elasticity of Demand
- < 0 → **Inferior Good**
- 0 to 1 → **Normal Good**
- > 1 → **Superior Good**

This explains how rising income affects consumption preferences:
- A consumer might stop buying an inferior good in favor of a superior good.

#### Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
- > 0 → **Substitute Goods**
- < 0 → **Complementary Goods**
- = 0 → **Independent Goods**

#### Elasticity of Supply
- Related to time and availability of production factors (capital, labor, inputs).
- The more easily inputs can be substituted, the more **elastic** the supply.
