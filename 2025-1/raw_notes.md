### Introduction to Economy

- Law of offer and demand
- - Offer is the desire to sell.
- - Demand is the desire to buy.
- - There is a graph drawn, in which it shows two lines over the price and quantity of a product.
- - Each line represents either the offer or the demand and they have only one intersection which is called the point of balance
- - When the quantity is high, the demand is low and the offer is high.
- - When the quantity is low the demand is high and the offer is low.
- - Two other concepts were introduced, the essentiality, which tells if the product is unique or can be replaced by a similar, and the market, which is the interaction of a person wanting to buy and a person wanting to sell.
- - Then a function to calculate demand was introduced, and it depended of the following variables: Price of the product and its similars products, income of the person and personal taste.
- - To study a specific variable, we think of other variables as constants, that way we can notice that the income of the person translates the demand line to the right, as the person now has more money so it can afford to buy bigger quantities of that product.
- - There is the study of the price too, if the price of a product is essential then the demand line is more vertical, if it is more horizontal I don't remember what it means
- - Elasticity measures the sensibility of demand over time, if its module is bigger than one then the demand is elastic, if it is lower than one then it is inelastic and if it is equal to one then it is called unitary elasticity
- - There are other types of elasticity, like the elasticity of the price and revenue, which is the price times the quantity. If this elasticity is unitary, it does not matter if the price or quantity changes, the variation of revenue will be close to 0.
- - There is also the elasticity of revenue of demand, if it is lower than zero then the product is considered a lower good, if it is between zero and one, then the product is a normal good, if it is bigger than one than the product is a superior good. That introduces the possibility of another consequence of bigger income, as if the person buys a lower good because it is what they can afford, they won't buy it anymore but replace it with a superior good if their income increases.
- - There is also the elasticity of crossed price, which measures the relation between prices of different goods, if it is bigger than zero then it is a replaceble good, if it is lower than zero then it is a complementary good, but if it is equal to 0 then it is an independant product.
- - Then there is the elasticity of offer, which relates time and product factors like capital, labor and inputs. The more there are replacebla inputs the better for an industry, as it may not be affected by the price of a specific input, because it can replace it.
