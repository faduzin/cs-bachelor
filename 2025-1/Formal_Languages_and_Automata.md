# Formal Languages and Automata

## 2025-1

### üìò Introduction to Formal Languages

- **Alphabet (Œ£):** A finite set of symbols. Every language is built from an alphabet. The serial sum symbol (Œ£) represents this set.
- **String:** A finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet.
- **Kleene Star (Œ£\***): Denotes the set of all possible strings (including the empty string Œµ) formed from an alphabet Œ£.
- **Language (L):** A language is a subset of Œ£\*, i.e., it consists of valid strings formed from the alphabet.

### ü§ñ Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

- A **DFA** is a theoretical machine used to recognize regular languages.
- It processes input strings **from left to right**, symbol by symbol.

#### **Definition Components:**

A DFA is defined as a 5-tuple:
**M = (Q, Œ£, Œ¥, q‚ÇÄ, F)**

Where:
- **Q**: A finite set of states.
- **Œ£**: The input alphabet (symbols).
- **Œ¥**: The transition function, which maps `Œ¥: Q √ó Œ£ ‚Üí Q`.
- **q‚ÇÄ**: The initial state (`q‚ÇÄ ‚àà Q`).
- **F**: The set of accepting/final states (`F ‚äÜ Q`).

#### **Key Concepts:**
- The automaton is **deterministic**, meaning from any given state and input symbol, there is exactly **one possible next state**.
- **Visual Representation:**
  - A triangle points to the **initial state**.
  - **Double circles** represent **accepting (final) states**.
- **Acceptance Condition:**
  - If, after reading the entire input string, the DFA ends in a state that belongs to **F**, then the string is **accepted** and belongs to the language.
  - Otherwise, it is **rejected**.

#### **Example Notation:**
- `Œ¥(q‚ÇÄ, a) = q‚ÇÅ` means that from the initial state `q‚ÇÄ`, upon reading symbol `a ‚àà Œ£`, the automaton transitions to state `q‚ÇÅ`.
