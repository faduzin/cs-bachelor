## Aggregate Concepts

- **Aggregate Product**: The sum of the final values of goods and services produced in an economy.
- **Aggregate Value**: The gross product value minus intermediate consumption.
- **Aggregate Income**: The sum of salaries, interest, rent, and profits.
- **Aggregate Expense**: The total spending or destination of the product.

## Circular Flow in a Closed Economy (No Government)

In a simplified economic model without government or foreign trade, aggregate product = aggregate income = aggregate expenses. This relationship is illustrated through two entities:

- **Families**:
  - Provide factors of production (labor, capital, land) to enterprises.
  - Receive income in return (wages, rent, interest, profit).
  - Spend income on goods and services.
- **Enterprises**:
  - Produce goods and services.
  - Pay families for production factors.
  - Sell goods and services to families.

All income received by families is assumed to be spent on goods and services in this model.

## Savings and Investment

- **Investment**: Acquisition of capital goods (e.g., machinery, tools) to increase productive capacity.
- **Savings**: The portion of income not spent on consumption by families.

When investment is introduced, the model relates savings and investments, balancing aggregate income and expenses.

## Role of Government

- **Taxes**:
  - *Direct Taxes*: Based on income.
  - *Indirect Taxes*: Applied to goods and services (affect disposable income).
- **Government Spending**: Should ideally match tax revenue, but in practice often exceeds it.
- **Fiscal Balance Equation**:
  
  \[
  S - I = G - T
  \]

  Where:
  - *S* = Savings
  - *I* = Investments
  - *G* = Government Spending
  - *T* = Taxes

- **Subsidy**: A negative tax — a payment by the government to reduce the market price of a product.
- **Market Price**: Equal to production cost (factor cost) plus indirect taxes (minus subsidies, if applicable).

## International Sector (Rest of the World)

- **Exports and Imports**: Introduced as additional flows.
- **Net Exports (Income Sent Abroad)**:

  \[
  ↑ Exports - ↓ Imports = Net income outflow
  \]

To balance government overspending, savings and positive net exports are often used.

## Other Key Concepts

- **Speculator**: An individual who takes financial risks in hopes of profit.
- **Personal Income**: 

  \[
  
  \text{Personal Income} = \text{National Product} - \text{Direct Taxes} - \text{Other Receipts} + \text{Government Transfers (e.g., pensions, unemployment benefits)}
  \]

## Final Extended Economic Model

Entities and flows in the complete economic model:

- **Families**:
  - Receive income from the factor market.
  - Pay taxes to the government.
  - Save in the financial market.
  - Consume goods and services.

- **Financial Market**:
  - Finances government deficits.
  - Channels investments into the goods and services market.

- **Government**:
  - Collects taxes from families.
  - Covers deficits through the financial market.
  - Spends in the goods and services market.

- **Goods and Services Market**:
  - Generates revenue for enterprises.
  - Enterprises use revenue to pay for factors of production.

- **Rest of the World**:
  - Receives exports and pays for them.
  - Sends imports into the domestic economy.
  - Participates in factor payments (both receiving and paying).
