# ðŸ“š Computer Science Bachelor's Degree - Learning Tracker

Welcome to my learning tracker repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive and structured record of everything I am learning throughout my final semesters in my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

## Purpose

The aim of this repository is to systematically document key concepts, projects, assignments, and reflections from each curricular unit. By regularly updating this repository, I intend to:

- Maintain clear and organized notes that facilitate review and retention.
- Provide a central hub to quickly revisit topics covered in my classes.
- Track my academic progress and the evolution of my understanding over time.
- Share my learning journey and insights with peers and the broader community.

## Repository Structure

Each curricular unit will have its own dedicated markdown file. The markdown files will include:
- Brief summaries of core concepts
- Key learnings and important takeaways
- Personal notes and insights
